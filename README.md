# Hello Hack Club!
------------------
This is my weather application, that is only functional in the town of Mission, British Columbia.

My original Intent for this was to make a simple website that would just grab the temperature data.
In my area, the internet connection is really slow, so making something that could load only the neccesary data in an instant would be spectatular!

Evantually, I decided to keep adding features to my site, including :
- Dynamicly Changing Background that changes with the time of Day (Morning, Noon, and night!)
- A Display for weather (e.g: fog, rain, clear skies, thunderstorms.etc)
- Temperature, and Apparent Temperture Displays,
as well as, a remarkable amount of IF statements for...

## P.A.W.
Paw, or Personal Assistant for the Weather is, well, that!
He will give you varrying information based on the current weather condition and temperature.
Paw does not use AI, and is instead based on about 100 lines of if statements.
His Design is heavily inspired by Rambley from Indigo Park.

I hope you enjoy my project!



Thanks to the open-meteo.com API for providing weather data!
